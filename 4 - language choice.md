I think message passing would be the way to move data around in this project. this is because it is often the way  across a distrubuted cluster like this task is with 3 different elevators, that should work together. I think we will be using very little concurrency, almost nothing i guess, most operations are very short, like a button click. light turn on, very small alogorithm for prioritating elevators etc. Just from reading about Go,and doing task 2 and 3 I can see that go is a way better language for this elevator lab. 

Go or Rust is a harder choice, but I think mostly depends on personal preferences. It seems that Rust is a bit better for debugging and you have more control, but are more complex language to write in. Go seems like a simpler language, and I have already learned some basic about it. The tutorials and libraryies for go are also quite easy understand. Go seems like the best choice to me.
